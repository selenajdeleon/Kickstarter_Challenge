# An analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

### Overview of Project
This project analyzes data from Kickstarter Campaigns to help identify trends that lead to the success or failures of campaigns. The analysis was done to help an artist gauge the potential success of her kickstarter campaign. Subcategories, color-coding, pictures, and other items were used to help easily identify trends in this data.

An overview of this data is displayed below:
